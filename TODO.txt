1. Add a 'subtitle' field to display in caption text next to monster name
2. Change to give monsters all a unique ID, can be from static field in class
- This means monsters can have duplicate names, migrate names to 'monster'
- use new 'subtitle' field as unique name in play
- Have caption field editable on the card

3. Support multiple quantity monsters 
- Aided by the ID system, as monsters can now just have the same name
- Could be done just my looping i times through addMonster

4. Add icon displays on card
- should really be 1

5. Support all health buttons
- Kill should remove from card deck
- Temp should set temp health
- Health should be {val + temp / max}
- If low, display current health as red
- If has temp HP, display current health as green
